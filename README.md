# Wonderware-Launcher
A python program that will launch Wonderware software (window maker and window viewer) on monitors with different resolutions than the resolution that the project was originally created on without converting the project

# The Problem
Wonderware projects are created using a certain resolution monitor. When attempting to open Wonderware software such as window maker and window viewer while using a monitor that has a different resolution than the original, Wonderware will make you convert the project to open it. When you convert the project, however, the interfaces you have designed can be shifted around causing your project to no longer display properly on monitors that different resolutions. This issue arises when the display you are developing or editing on is a different reolution than the displays you are deploying on.

The real problem lies within Wonderware itself, but since there's nothing we can do about that we have to find a way around the problem. The 2 solutions I have found thus far are either:

1. Have a second monitor that is the same resolution as the displays you are deploying to and make that display your main display before launching window maker or window viewer and then change your main display back.

2. Change the resolution of your monitor to match the reolution of the screens you are deploying to.
